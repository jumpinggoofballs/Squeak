# Squeak

## To Do: 

1. Encrypt local database
2. Transmit images, avatars and files (encrypted)

3. Re-work the notifications and confirmations on the backend on the model of the messages for bulk collection
4. Split app-store into localStore and remoteStore
5. Fancy alerts (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-fancyalert)
6. Change encoding of encrypted messages (emojis crash the app because they cannot decrypt) -- probably to some kind of large-byte Unicode
7. Secure the firebase stuff with the permissions
